# Rust Turing Arena Light

This is a Rust implementation of a client for the Turing Arena Light specification.

1. `rtal` (the rust implementation of the TA-light client)

This document explains how to build up all these `TALight` commands for your architecture.
Do not scare because:

1. the process is simple and you will be followed step as step;

2. you will not need to use nor know anything about Rust.


## Building the needed binaries

In order to build this project, you will first need a working installation of the Rust compiler and Cargo.
If you don't already have these, the official service [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) from the rust community will guide you with updated instructions through the few simple steps needed to set these up. The service assumes you have a terminal at your disposal (which, in case you are on a Windows platform, can be the CMD). The terminal il also a main companion and your close friend in enjoying the TALight services.

Once Rust is set up, you have two options for the kinds of builds you intend to obtain.
The `Relase build` is by far more efficient in term of performances.
The `Debug build` provides you with more detailed information when you use it. For what it costs, we actually suggest you to make them both.
However, using the debug version (binaries placed in the `~/TALight/rtal/target/debug` folder) rather than the release version (binaries placed in the `~/TALight/rtal/relase/debug` folder) is the best choice and practice when you are working as a problem maker (or as a problem solver). On the other side, the release version offers more performances and should be the preferred one when the server rtald is deployed in the cloud. However, when deploying rtald in the cloud, you are likely to opt for a `static build` so that you can offer to your students an executable version of the client rtal. In this way your students do not even need to get rtal installed on their machines, nor they need to clone any git report.

### Debug build

To build this project in debug mode, first move to the directory `rtal` of this repo as downloaded on your local machine, and then issue the command:
```bash
cargo build
```
Before launching the above command you will periodically need to update rust. Hence, in case you get any errors, try resolving them with:
```bash
rustup update
```

When no problem is encountered, you'll then find the built binaries in `target/debug/`.

### Release build

To build this project in release mode, first move to the directory `rtal` of this repo as downloaded on your local machine, and then issue the command:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
Before launching the above command you will periodically need to update rust. Hence, in case you get any errors, try resolving them with:
```bash
rustup update
```

When no problem is encountered, you'll then find the built binaries in `target/release/`.


### Static release build for generic linux

Again, before actually launching the compiler you may need to update `rust`, which is periodically needed as `TALight` and `rust` advance:
```bash
rustup update
```
Moreover, if you never did it before on your machine (you need to do this only once for every target architecture you will need), you should first run a command like the following:
```bash
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```
With this, we added to `rust` the possibility to build a static program for the generic linux architecture (taht is, our binaries will work on any linux distro).

Finally, we can yield static binaries for the architectures we want to serve, for example:


```bash
cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```
